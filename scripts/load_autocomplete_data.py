"""
Python script to take all of the data from the main table ORGANISMS and populate the AUTOCOMPLETE_SELECTION table.
On the front end, 30,000 rows of data is too much for the search/autocomplete field - so I wneed to narrow it down more - 
I found that the intra-species codon usage data doesn't vary much...
...that is, various strains of a certain species don't need to be codon-optimized individually. The strain can be trated
as a whole species.

Thus, I need to filter the data from the whole table so it only takes one strain from one species and displays that to
the user on the front end - down the line, I could definitely see this causing some issues, but for now this is my fix.

Algorithm:
	
	names = []

	result = SELECT * FROM ORGANISMS
	for row in result:
		name = get_species_name(result.name)
		if name in names:
			continue
		else:
			names.append(name)
			INSERT row INTO AUTOCOMPLETE_SELECTION
