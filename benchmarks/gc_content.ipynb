    "# Analyzing the GC-Content of codon-optimized sequence\n",
    "GC-Content is the percentage of nitrogenous bases in a DNA or RNA molecule that are either guanine or cytosine. This mearsure is often cited as being important for applications of molecular biology, genomics, and systematics. We leverage it here to assess the similarity in sequence optimization between *Optipyzer* and other codon optimiation tools, namely Integrated DNA Technology's (IDT).\n",
    "\n",
    "We identified 55 functional protein sequences that were randomly generated (Kefee and Szostak, 2001). These sequences were originally expressed in *Escherichia coli*, as such, they were optimized for expression in *Homo sapiens*. They were optimized on two platforms: IDT, and *Optipyzer*. After analysis, the sequences were analyzed for their GC-Content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## IDT Optimization\n",
    "To utilize IDT's codon optimization you must first register. Once complete, you can access their web-interface. The optimization was ran with the following parameters using their **bulk input**:\n",
    "- Sequence type: Amino Acids\n",
    "- Product type: Gene\n",
    "- Organism: Homo sapiens\n",
    "- Delimiter: FASTA\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequences were pasted into their tool and submitted. Once complete, the sequences were extracted using a console script. See [this](js/extract_idt_sequences.js) JavaScript file. The script was pasted into the console directly. The resulting file was formatted into a FASTA file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optipyzer Optimization\n",
    "The optipyzer package will be utilized to optimize the sequences:"
